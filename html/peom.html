    		“Twenty five years gone and still motoring on,<br>Life has been a crazy freaky journey, <br>for me to move along; It’s not gonna be an itchy poem and neither an lousy song, <br>
    		Mix of care, hate, love and stress is what’s in store and
 I’m not gonna prolong;<br>
 

Born like an arc, with full of spark,<br>

Smiles galore and never miss to make a mark;<br>

Truncated and shielded from all the happenings in life,<br>

One lovely soul braved me from all the striking strife;<br>

The narrowest path was followed for educational excellence,<br>

Nor I was good…nor I was bad, sheer boring brilliance;<br>

Structured and no-nonsense, nah! I ain’t bragging,<br>
 it’s just what’s on plate, <br>

I crawled and sprinkled towards the end without showing any hesitate; <br>

Life took a turn when I enforced out and saw scintillating <br>
 yet obnoxious reality; <br>

Different people, different work and different situation was served <br>
 with un-denying royalty;<br>

Embarked them all with rise and fall along with exquisite creativity;<br>

End of the day, I came back to bed, shred all feelings and enact inactivity;<br>

Some years have zoomed and some have snailed, <br>


There hasn’t been anything yet which I convincingly nailed;<br>

Calculacious and zombastic the time flies by and goes for a drive, <br>

OMG!!! Is it true, did I really turn Twenty Five? “ </p>
