        <strong>Nobody’s born smart. </strong> We all start at 0. Can’t <strong>talk,</strong> can’t <strong>walk,</strong> certainly can’t do <strong>algebra.</strong><br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to <strong>10</strong>.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you <strong>walk</strong>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your <strong>brain</strong> a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you <strong>don’t</strong> get it. <br>
        You just <strong>don’t</strong> get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful,complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever</strong> you are, wherever you are.<br>

        <em>You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.</em>
